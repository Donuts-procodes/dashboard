## Build and Deploy

#### This project uses gh-pages to deploy to GitHub Pages.

### Build for production and deploy:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
- This command builds the app and publishes the dist folder to the gh-pages branch.

- Make sure package.json includes the correct homepage field:
```json
"homepage": "https://Donuts-procodes.github.io/dashboard" 
```
- Also, to ensure proper asset referencing, the vite.config.js contains:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  base: "/dashboard/",
  plugins: [react()]
});
```
### After deploy, your app will be available at:

```text
https://Donuts-procodes.github.io/dashboard/
```
